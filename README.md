# ID-Scanner

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The ID Scanner project is a versatile application designed to scan identification cards, read barcodes, and detect faces within the ID cards. Built with Python, this project leverages image processing and computer vision techniques to extract information from ID cards efficiently. Whether used for identity verification, access control, or data collection, the ID Scanner offers a powerful solution for various applications.

## âš™ Features

- **ID Card Scanning**: The application allows users to scan identification cards quickly and accurately, capturing essential information such as name, ID number, and date of birth.

- **Barcode Reading**: With barcode reading capabilities, the ID Scanner can extract data encoded in barcodes printed on ID cards, providing additional information for verification purposes.

- **Face Detection**: Using advanced facial recognition algorithms, the project can detect and analyze faces within the scanned ID cards, enabling identity verification and facial biometrics.

- **Versatility**: The ID Scanner supports a wide range of identification card formats and types, making it suitable for various industries and use cases, including security, hospitality, and healthcare.

## ðŸ’» Installation

1) **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2) **Required Libraries** : This project uses several Python libraries for data analysis and GUI development. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
## ðŸ•¹ Run Locally

1) Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RaST-EDITH/ID-Scanner.git
```

2) Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd ID-Scanner
```

3) Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
  python -m venv venv
```

4) Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS and Linux:

```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
```

5) Install the project dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6) Now, you have all the necessary packages installed in your virtual environment. You can start using the project. 
To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done, simply run:

```bash
  deactivate
```
## ðŸ“Š Usage

- **Database Integration**: The extracted information is stored in a centralized database along with employee records and access permissions.

- **Access Point Deployment**: Access control points equipped with ID Scanners are installed at various entry points throughout the premises.

- **Identity Verification**: When an employee approaches an access point, they present their ID card to the scanner.The ID Scanner reads the barcode on the ID card and performs facial recognition to verify the employee's identity.

- **Access Granting**: If the employee's identity is successfully verified and they have the necessary access permissions, the access control system grants them entry.

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: The ID Scanner continuously monitors access points and logs entry/exit events in real-time.
Security personnel can view access logs and receive alerts for any unauthorized access attempts.
